In studying statistics, you will learn how to organize and make conclusions from data. The activity of organizing and drawing conclusions from the data is referred to as descriptive statistics. There are many ways how we conclude a data, for example by making a graph or with numbers, for example taking an average of the data. Furthermore, when you have to make decisions from data that has been processed, you will then use inferential statistics so that you can make the right decisions from data that has also been processed correctly.
